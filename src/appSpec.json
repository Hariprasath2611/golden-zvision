Text and interactive elements predominantly use a deep navy blue, ensuring strong contrast and readability. Accent colors in subtle pastel purple and yellow appear in small UI elements, adding gentle vibrancy without overwhelming the design. Typography is geometric sans-serif, with large, bold headings paired with lighter, well-spaced body text to enhance clarity and hierarchy. The layout employs modular grids with generous negative space, balancing text and iconography in a harmonious, user-friendly manner. Buttons are solid, rounded rectangles with dark backgrounds and white text, emphasizing clear calls to action. Overall, the design conveys professionalism, approachability, and efficiency, making it highly adaptable for educational platforms, professional services, and technology brands seeking a clean and trustworthy online presence.",

      "paletteUsageGuide": "Use the 'primary' color for all interactive elements such as buttons, links, and highlights to draw user attention and reinforce brand identity. The 'primaryForeground' color should be used for text or icons placed on 'primary' backgrounds to ensure readability. The 'secondary' color serves as the main background for dark-themed sections, with 'secondaryForeground' used for text and icons on these dark backgrounds. The 'background' color is the default page background for light-themed sections, with 'textPrimary' used for body text and headings on this background. The 'darkBackground' and 'textSecondary' colors are used for high-contrast dark mode or section backgrounds and their corresponding text. This palette ensures strong contrast and accessibility while maintaining a clean and modern aesthetic. Colors should be combined thoughtfully to maintain readability and visual hierarchy, with 'primary' reserved for calls to action and emphasis, and 'secondary' and 'background' providing structural balance.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "The combination of 'primary' (#D94A1B) on 'primaryForeground' (#FFFFFF) meets WCAG AA standards for text and interactive elements, ensuring sufficient contrast. The 'secondary' (#000000) background with 'secondaryForeground' (#FFFFFF) text provides excellent contrast exceeding WCAG AAA standards. The 'background' (#FFFFFF) with 'textPrimary' (#000000) also meets WCAG AAA contrast requirements for body text. This palette supports accessibility best practices across light and dark sections, ensuring legibility and user comfort."
